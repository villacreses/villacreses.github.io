        Recognizing the need for better public education, my team built a sex education video platform, enabling
        youth to explore questions on human sexuality with guidance from health science educators.

        My team's efforts not only won us the competition, but also brought positive publicity to the whole
        event. We were featured in 
        [Brooklyn Magazine](https://www.bkmag.com/2018/09/06/4-brooklyn-entrepreneurs-on-how-their-style-impacts-business/),
        [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/estrellajaramillo/2018/09/18/technology-meets-sex-to-solve-some-of-the-most-pressing-concerns-of-our-times),
        and [Men's Health](https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/a23064407/sex-tech-hackathon/). 
        For a brief period, our project was even considered for official curriculum integration within select NYC high schools.
