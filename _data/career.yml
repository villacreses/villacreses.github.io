        I support the development of English-language AI agents by evaluating and refining their responses for clarity, 
        tone, and accessibility across varying levels of language proficiency. My work includes adjusting verbosity 
        based on context and ensuring that AI communication remains inclusive, accurate, and socially responsible. I 
        also review AI-generated answers to undergraduate-level math questions, verifying both accuracy and the relevance 
        of the methods used.

        At GoDaddy, I led two major modernization efforts: migrating the frontend from Ember.js to Next.js—rolled 
        out seamlessly with no disruption to merchants—and separately, overhauling the DevOps pipeline using Docker

        At Meta, I worked on a company-wide metrics platform that standardized how teams defined and accessed performance 
        data. On the backend, I improved the reliability of the Metric Authoring API, reducing latency and making it 
        easier to define and query metrics. On the frontend, I scaled the internal web portal to support growing data 
        demands across the organization. I also mentored interns on engineering best practices, helping them navigate 
        Meta’s internal tools and development workflows.

        doc.ai built a suite of AI-powered healthcare apps, and I joined the team developing their new flagship product: a 
        medical trials app. I built a WYSIWYG editor that let pharmaceutical companies design custom journaling flows—no 
        coding required—which trial participants could then access through the app to submit data in study-specific formats. 
        Separately, I created a real-time map visualizing COVID-19 transmission, which significantly boosted the company’s 
        visibility during the early pandemic.
