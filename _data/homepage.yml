  Hey, I’m Mario! I’m a software engineer with six years of experience, currently 
  freelancing while pursuing a master’s in computer science.

  Coming from a working-class background, I’ve always seen the web as more than just a platform—it’s a pathway. 
  I’m drawn to work that lowers barriers and helps self-learners thrive—because access, when paired with 
  curiosity, can change everything. 


  That belief has shaped how I build. Over the years, I’ve designed tools, untangled systems, and worked across 
  industries to make technology feel more human. From fast-moving startups to household names, each chapter has 
  sharpened how I think, what I create, and how I collaborate.
