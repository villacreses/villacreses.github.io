        Since leaving GoDaddy, I have been focused on advancing my education and pursuing a Master&apos;s degree in
        Computer
        Science. To make that possible, I&apos;ve been freelancing, which gives me the flexibility I need to focus on my
        studies.
      </p>
      <p class="prose">
        While I remain open to discussing full-time opportunities, I am committed to ensuring that any role I take
        aligns with my academic goals and does not require me to put my education on hold.

            <strong>Back to basics:</strong>
            Converted my personal website from a Next.js + Tailwind app to a minimal website consisting of HTML, CSS,
            and vanilla Javascript; and I did it all without sacrificing accessibility, responsive styling, or dark
            mode. Goodbye <code>npm update</code>!

            I&apos;ve gotten quite far knowing just Javascript, Python, and Java; but my intellectual curiosity extends
            beyond mere career serviceability. To that end, I&apos;m currently learning Elixir and Rust through a
            variety of resources.

            I&apos;m still on a quest to drop the last of my COVID-era weight. Yoga has helped me get over several
            injuries, and I intend to restart running this year after a 3-year hiatus.
