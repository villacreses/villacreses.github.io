      Since leaving GoDaddy, I have been focused on advancing my education and pursuing a Master&apos;s degree in Computer
      Science. To make that possible, I&apos;ve been freelancing, which gives me the flexibility I need to focus on my studies.
    </p>
    <p class="prose">
      While I remain open to discussing full-time opportunities, I am committed to ensuring that any role I take
      aligns with my academic goals and does not require me to put my education on hold.

          <strong>Back to basics:</strong>
          Converted my personal website from a Next.js + Tailwind app to a minimal website consisting of HTML, CSS,
          and vanilla Javascript; and I did it all without sacrificing accessibility, responsive styling, or dark
          mode. Goodbye <code>npm update</code>!

          I&apos;ve gotten quite far knowing just Javascript, Python, and Java; but my intellectual curiosity extends
          beyond mere career serviceability. To that end, I&apos;m currently learning Elixir and Rust through a
          variety of resources.

          I&apos;m still on a quest to drop the last of my COVID-era weight. Yoga has helped me get over several
          injuries, and I intend to restart running this year after a 3-year hiatus.
