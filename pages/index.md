Hey, I’m Mario! I’m a software engineer with six years of experience, currently freelancing but looking
for new full-time opportunities.
{ .lead }

Across my career, I've led high-impact engineering efforts—from modernizing product infrastructure 
at GoDaddy to building medical trial tools at doc.ai and scaling internal platforms at Meta. I've 
consistently blended modular architecture, accessible UX, and ethical data handling to deliver systems 
that are both technically robust and socially attuned.
