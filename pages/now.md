Since leaving GoDaddy, I have been focused on advancing my education and pursuing a Master&apos;s 
degree in Computer Science. To make that possible, I&apos;ve been freelancing, which gives me the 
flexibility I need to focus on my studies.

While I remain open to discussing full-time opportunities, I am committed to ensuring that any role 
I take aligns with my academic goals and does not require me to put my education on hold.

- **Back to basics:** Converted my personal website from a Next.js + Tailwind app to a minimal website 
  consisting of HTML, CSS, and vanillas Javascript; and I did it all without sacrificing accessibility, 
  responsive styling, or dark mode. Goodbye `npm update`!

- **Master's Degree:** I've begun my journey towards earning a Master of Computer Science at Arizona 
  State University. Expected graduation: Autumn 2026.
- **Learning new programming languages:** I&apos;ve gotten quite far knowing just Javascript, Python, 
  and Java; but my intellectual curiosity extends beyond mere career serviceability. To that end, I&apos;m 
  currently learning Elixir and Rust through a variety of resources.

- #### **Foundation (series)** by Isaac Asimov

  My wife has been insisting for months that I read this series, and so far I&apos;m grateful that 
  she did. The series&apos; sustained relevance astounds me to no end.
- #### **The Pragmatic Programmer** by Andrew Hunt &amp; David Thomas

  Every once in a while, I like to refresh myself on the classics of software engineering.

- I&apos;m still on a quest to drop the last of my COVID-era weight. Yoga has helped me get over 
  several injuries, and I intend to restart running this year after a 3-year hiatus.
