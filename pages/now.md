Since leaving GoDaddy, I’ve focused on freelance development and deepening my technical foundation. This 
period has been a mix of client work, personal projects, and self-directed study—an intentional pause to 
refine my craft and explore new directions. I remain open to full-time opportunities that align with my 
values and technical interests.

- **Switched website to Eleventy:** I switched from Next.js to HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to 
  simplify my toolset, avoiding processors and bundlers. However, I missed features like markdown 
  rendering and external data integration. Discovering Eleventy offered the ideal balance of simplicity 
  while keeping the development experience enjoyable.

- **Intellectual Curiosity:** I've taken full advantage of my flexible schedule to pursue a long overdue
  catch-up with several pet projects, predominantly doing an exploratory deep dive into various mathematical
  texts.
- **Fitness Journey:** I've been practicing yoga with greater frequency over the past few months. My
  goal is to return to my pre-COVID levels of fitness, where I could maintain a 10 min/mi running 
  pace and bike at least 15 miles a day. 
- **Portfolio pieces:** Within a few weeks, I'll start regularly addingnew projects to my portfolio.
  These projects display mastery over various stages of full stack development.

### {% icon "fa-solid fa-book-open-reader" %} Currently Reading

- #### **Foundation (series)** by Isaac Asimov

  My wife has been insisting for months that I read this series, and so far I'm grateful that 
  she did. The series' sustained relevance astounds me to no end.
- #### **The Pragmatic Programmer** by Andrew Hunt & David Thomas

  Every once in a while, I like to refresh myself on the classics of software engineering.
