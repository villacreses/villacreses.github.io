Since leaving GoDaddy, I have been focused on advancing my education and pursuing a Master's degree 
in Computer Science. To make that possible, I've been freelancing, which gives me the flexibility I 
need to focus on my studies.

While I remain open to discussing full-time opportunities, I am committed to ensuring that any role 
I take aligns with my academic goals and does not require me to put my education on hold.

- **Switched website to Eleventy:** I switched from Next.js to HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to 
  simplify my toolset, avoiding processors and bundlers. However, I missed features like markdown 
  rendering and external data integration. Discovering Eleventy offered the ideal balance of simplicity 
  while keeping the development experience enjoyable.

### {% icon "fa-solid fa-screwdriver-wrench" %} Working on

- **Master's Degree:** I've begun my journey towards earning a Master of Computer Science at Arizona 
  State University. Expected graduation: Autumn 2026. 
- **Fitness Journey:** I've been practicing yoga with greater frequency over the past few months. My
  goal is to return to my pre-COVID levels of fitness, where I could maintain a 10 min/mi running 
  pace and bike at least 15 miles a day. 

### {% icon "fa-solid fa-book-open-reader" %} Currently Reading

- #### **Foundation (series)** by Isaac Asimov

  My wife has been insisting for months that I read this series, and so far I'm grateful that 
  she did. The series' sustained relevance astounds me to no end.
- #### **The Pragmatic Programmer** by Andrew Hunt & David Thomas

  Every once in a while, I like to refresh myself on the classics of software engineering.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In late June, a mother cat settled herself in my backyard with a newborn litter of 3 and I've been
  taking care of them since. I unfortunately can't keep them and have been trying to find forever 
  homes for each of them.

> So far, I've found a forever home for one kitten, but the other two (both males) and the mother are 
  still in need of new owners. If you know anybody in the NYC tristate area that would be interested
  in adopting one, please reach out!
