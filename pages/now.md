Since leaving GoDaddy, I’ve focused on freelance development and deepening my technical foundation. This 
period has been a mix of client work, personal projects, and self-directed study—an intentional pause to 
refine my craft and explore new directions. I remain open to full-time opportunities that align with my 
values and technical interests.

- **Switched website to Eleventy:** I switched from Next.js to HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to 
  simplify my toolset, avoiding processors and bundlers. However, I missed features like markdown 
  rendering and external data integration. Discovering Eleventy offered the ideal balance of simplicity 
  while keeping the development experience enjoyable.

- **Fitness Journey:** I've been practicing yoga with greater frequency over the past few months. My
  goal is to return to my pre-COVID levels of fitness, where I could maintain a 10 min/mi running 
  pace and bike at least 15 miles a day. 
- **Portfolio pieces:** Within a few weeks, I'll start regularly adding new projects to my portfolio.
  These projects display mastery over various stages of full stack development.
- **AWS Certifications:** I've felt for a long time that my resume does not fully reflect the extent of my 
  knowledge of Amazon Web Services. To better signal this, I'll be obtaining certifications indicative of
  my current experience, as well as where I want to be.

### {% icon "fa-solid fa-book-open-reader" %} Currently Reading

- #### **Foundation (series)** by Isaac Asimov

  My wife has been insisting for months that I read this series, and so far I'm grateful that 
  she did. The series' sustained relevance astounds me to no end.
- #### **How the Internet Became Commercial** by Shane Greenstein

  Rarely does an author present the evolution of the Internet as not just a series of infrastructure improvements,
  but as an ongoing conflict between idealists and various self-interested parties. Shane Greenstein compellingly 
  balances both perspectives.
