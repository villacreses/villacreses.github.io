I had originally intended to downgrade my website's tech stack from Next.js + Tailwind to plain HTML + CSS + JS. But GitHub's built-in Jekyll integrations were too tempting to not take advantage of. 

Especially after frustrations in updating meta tags and having to copy-paste the same header/footer onto every page.
